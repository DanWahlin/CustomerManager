Customer Manager with AngularJS (with custom routing)
===============

If you’re new to AngularJS check out my [AngularJS in 60-ish Minutes](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/04/12/video-tutorial-angularjs-fundamentals-in-60-ish-minutes.aspx) video tutorial or download the [free eBook](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/07/30/angularjs-in-60-ish-minutes-the-ebook.aspx). Also check out [The AngularJS Magazine](http://flip.it/bdyUX) for up-to-date information on using AngularJS to build Single Page Applications (SPAs).

This version of the application has support for custom routing. See this [this post](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/05/22/dynamically-loading-controllers-and-views-with-angularjs-and-requirejs.aspx) for more details. The standard version of the application with no custom routing can be [found here](https://github.com/DanWahlin/CustomerManagerStandard).

This application demonstrates:

* A complete application with read-only and editable data
* Using AngularJS with $http in a factory to access a backend Web API service
* Using BreezeJS in a factory to access a backend Web API Service
* Techniques for showing multiple views of data (card view and list view)
* A custom filter for filtering customer data
* A custom routing mechanism that allows a controller & template to be downloaded dynamically "on the fly" and provides a standard convention for controller and view names (see [this post](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/05/22/dynamically-loading-controllers-and-views-with-angularjs-and-requirejs.aspx)
 for more details)
* A custom directive to ensure unique values in a form for email
* A custom directive that intercepts $http and jQuery XHR requests (in case either are used) and displays a loading dialog

The factories can be switched by changing the app/services/config useBreeze setting to true.

The AngularJS portion of the app is structured using the following folders:

## Requirements:

###If you're using Visual Studio and .NET:

The following is required to support the backend services:

* Visual Studio 2012 Web Express (free version) or higher - http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products#product-express-summary

* ASP.NET MVC and Web API are used for the back-end services along with Entity Framework for database access (included if you have VS 2012 express installed)

To get started, double-click the CustomerManager.sln file located at the root of the CustomerManager repository. Once the solution loads press F5 to run the project.


###If you're using Node.js/Express/MongoDB

If you don't already have Node.js on your machine install it from http://nodejs.org. You'll also need to install MongoDB from http://www.mongodb.org if you don't have it already and get it configured and running using the instructions on their site.

In the CustomerManager directory execute 'npm install' to install Express, MongoDB and Mongoose (package.json).

Load sample data into MongoDB by performing the following steps:

* Execute 'mongod' to start the MongoDB daemon
* Navigate to the CustomerManager directory (the one that has initMongoCustData.js in it) then execute 'mongo' to start the MongoDB shell
* Enter the following in the mongo shell to load the seed files:
 * use custmgr
 * load("initMongoCustData.js")
 * load("initMongoSettingsData.js")
 * load("initMongoStateData.js")

Start the Node/Express server:
* navigate to the CustomerManager/server directory then execute 'node app.js'

View the application at http://localhost:3000
